vocl: tell your computer to do stuff
====================================
Apparently this [has been done before](https://lwn.net/Articles/217301/), but I
haven't done it. I intend to make a program that can run in the background of an
interactive desktop session and listen to the user whistle commands to it.

Right now, it just reports the largest component of the Fourier transform for a
chunk of samples.
